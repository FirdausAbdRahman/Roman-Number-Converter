# A Roman Numeral Converter using Vanilla JavaScript

It's my second project that I've developed through freeCodeCamp curriculum. I upgraded it to a simple web app.

I've added 2 feature options (need to manually adjust the file to chose the option) :

	Option 1 => Press 'convert' button to convert the number to Roman.

	Option 2 => Automatically convert the number to Roman once you type the number.
