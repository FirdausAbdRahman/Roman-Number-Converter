# A Fully-Functional Roman-Numeral Converter using Vanilla JavaScript

It's my second project that I've developed through freeCodeCamp curriculum. I've upgraded this project to a fully-functional web app that 
not only converts number into Roman numeral, and also vice versa.

A brief introduction about roman numerals:

1. Roman numerals are a numeric system that originated in Ancient Rome.
2. Roman numerals have no concepts of negative numbers & zero.

For more details, you can click on the title of this app.
