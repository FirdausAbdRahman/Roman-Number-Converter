# A Fully-Functional Roman-Numeral Converter using Vanilla JavaScript

It's my second project that I've developed through freeCodeCamp curriculum. I finally upgraded it to a fully-functional web app that 
converts number into Roman numeral, and Roman numeral into number.

I've added 2 feature options (need to manually adjust the file to chose the option) :

	Option 1 => Press 'convert' button to convert the number to Roman, and vice versa

	Option 2 => Automatically convert the number to Roman numeral once you type the number, and vice versa.
